        <h1>Marley My Pet Dog!</h1>
        <p>I am Joy and Marley is my pet dog,i'd also say Marley is my Miracle.
            Marley and Joy didn't meet in a good way,it was rather in a tragic 
            scene,I met Marley in the big city(adventure city),where he was abandoned as a puppy.
        </p>
        <p>I first saw Marley crossing a really busy road and i watched him almost hit by a van,
           I took it to myself to stop the car from hitting Marley and at that moment i didn't see
           a puppy,i saw a brave dog in Marley and So i decided to  take Marley in.
        </p>
        <p>It's been 7years now with Marley and i can't say i regret taking him in.Marley is a labrador
            retreiver. Unlike other Dogs Marley isn't a cute,shy lovely dog,he is instead husky,social,and big dog.</p>
        <p>PS;Marley would spend alot of his time chewing off pens ,tearing couches and running after 
            other dogs in th neighbourhood
